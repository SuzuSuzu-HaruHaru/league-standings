## Quick start

To use the package, simply instantiate a new `LeagueTable` object via

```javascript
const teams = ["San Marino", "Italy", "Spain", "France"];
const table = new LeagueTable({
    teams: teams
});
```
where `team` is here an array of ***unique*** identifiers of any type (ideally strings containing the names of the teams, as per the example above). Matches can be added via the `addMatches()` method

```javascript
const matches = [
    [1, 1, "Spain", "San Marino", 2, 0],
    [2, 1, "Italy", "Spain", 9, 4],
    [3, 2, "France", "San Marino", 20, 0],
    [4, 2, "Italy", "France", 6, 7],
    [5, 3, "Italy", "San Marino", 1, 0],
    [6, 3, "Spain", "France", 3, 0]
];
table.addMatches(matches);
```
where `matches` is here an array of arrays, each representing one match. As per the example above, any match array must have entries that are respectively: a ***unique*** identifier for each match; the matchday; the unique identifier of the home team; the unique identifier of the away team; the number of points scored by the home team; and finally the number of points scored by the away team.

Finally, the standings can be retrieved via

```javascript
table.standings();
```
The result will be an array of objects containing all the properties of the various teams.
